**Title:** 
Enhancing Model Performance with Bagging: Classification and Regression Analysis

**Description:**
This project explores the application of Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) in both classification and regression tasks. Bagging is a robust ensemble learning technique that aims to improve model accuracy by training multiple instances of a base model on different subsets of the training data. This project uses synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate how Bagging can enhance the performance of classifiers and regressors compared to standard single-model approaches. Specifically, the project applies Bagging to a classification problem using the `make_moons` dataset and a regression problem using a placement dataset.

**Objective:**
1. **Understand Bagging:** Learn the fundamentals of Bagging, including its mechanism and advantages such as reducing overfitting, improving prediction accuracy, and handling noisy or imbalanced data.
2. **Apply Bagging in Classification:** Implement Bagging with Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) and compare its performance against Random Forest Classifiers on a synthetic dataset.
3. **Apply Bagging in Regression:** Implement Bagging with Linear Regression and evaluate its performance against Random Forest Regressors on a real-world placement dataset.
4. **Evaluate Model Performance:** Compare the effectiveness of Bagging with other ensemble methods and assess improvements in prediction accuracy and model stability for both classification and regression tasks.
